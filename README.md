# Laptop-Price-Prediction


## Introduction

This project aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various features such as brand, processor, RAM, and other specifications. Using machine learning techniques, the model analyzes historical data to understand patterns and make predictions for new laptop configurations. This project can be helpful for consumers, retailers, and manufacturers to understand price ranges and trends.

## Dataset

Company: The manufacturer of the laptop (e.g., Dell, HP, Lenovo).
Typename: the type of laptop(e.g., Notebook etc).
Screeen Resolution: width and height of laptop.
Processor: Information about the CPU (e.g., Intel i5, AMD Ryzen 5).
RAM: Amount of memory in GB.
Storage: Type and capacity of storage (e.g., 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD).
Display: Size and resolution of the screen.
Operating System: The OS pre-installed on the laptop.
Price: The target variable, representing the price of the laptop.

## Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical computations
scikit-learn for machine learning models
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
Gradio for creating the app interface.
## Results
The final model achieved an RÂ² score of 85%, indicating that it can accurately predict laptop prices based on input features. The following models were trained and evaluated:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Support Vector Regressor

## Future Work

Improve feature engineering to include more detailed specifications.
Experiment with other machine learning models like Gradient Boosting.
Enhance the Gradio app with additional features and a more user-friendly interface.
